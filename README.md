- 👋 Hello, I’m Herman H.
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Development using a variety of programming tools that fits the problem such as PHP, Laravel, Django, Javascript, Python, C, VBA ect.  I am not really picky about the programming language as long as it fits the problem and environment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C & C++ to create a datalogger that "catches" pressure measurements of an irrigation system as well as updating a grape picker productivity system using Laravel and Python. 
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate on any Laravel and Kivy projects, and if there is room for learning any other programming project that is looking for an extra helping hand.
- 📫 You can reach me on my public mail account hh8686@yandex.com.
